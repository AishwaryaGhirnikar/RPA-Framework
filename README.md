# RPA Framework

* RPA Framework is a collection of open-source libraries and tools for Robotic Process Automation (RPA), and it is designed to be used with both Robot Framework and Python. The goal is to offer well-documented and actively maintained core libraries for Software Robot Developers.
Most robotic process automation initiatives fail to get off the ground because the current drag-and-drop offerings are expensive and frustrating for developers. 
* Robocorp is a Python-based open source stack for automating applications and processes. It is used for Robotic Process Automation Framework. Automate any task you can imagine with hundreds of keywords and libraries with performance, scalability, and security built-in. Our cloud robots can run on any platform from any machine, and scale horizontally to ensure mission-critical processes complete as efficiently as possible.
